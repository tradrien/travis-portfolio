  <p>Welcome to Travis' Portfolio webpage! This is the place to be to discover who Travis is and explore some of his work.</p>
  <p>The following is a poem that was written by Travis in January 2007:</p>
  <p><h3><em>"She Has Me"</em></h3></p>
  <p>Oh, how quickly you will see,<br>
    how she has won me, ... my heart's glee,</p>
    
    <p>Her with that long black hair,<br>
    and those eyes,<br>
    into which I am drawn to stare,<br>
    yet I tell you she doesn't care</p>
    
    <p>To me, she said, "I like this other guy a lot,"<br>
    and even had I fought,<br> 
    I'd have nought but this measly pen<br>
    and this love-sick heart &nbsp; &nbsp; beat</p>
    
    <p>This lovely lady,<br>
    had me upon the very day we met,<br>
    and so it is,<br>
    she has me yet.     
    </p>
