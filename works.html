    <h2>Information Technology</h2>
    <p><b>Audio Visual Upgrades</b></p> 
    <p>This often would tie in with the summer computer lab maintenance work my team would do. I would be assigned to upgrade the AV equipment at the podium station in specific classrooms. This would include installing an Extron controller and switcher/scaler. Also, if the projector in the classroom was a lamp-based projector, I would need to replace it with a new laser projector. Often, the setup would include the installation of a Kramer VIA device. The Kramer VIA would allow one to wirelessly stream content from a laptop or mobile device.

    <p><b>Summer Computer Lab Maintenance Work</b></p>
    <p>Each summer, my team would need to complete our yearly maintenance in the computer labs. I would be assigned a number of rooms to work on. If we needed help with this work, we could have our colleagues assist us. If the computers in the lab needed to be replaced, the existing computers would first need to be physically removed from the lab. We would then setup the new computers in the lab. Once all the computers were connected, we could install Windows on them by imaging them over the network. Once I signed off on a classroom being completed, another analyst would be assigned to do Quality Assurance check of the classroom.
