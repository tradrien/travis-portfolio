    <p>Travis is also a hobbyist <a name="poetry">poet/writer.</a> He always enjoyed doing creative writing assignments in school. He also wrote a number of poems when he was a teenager and has thought about publishing a poetry book one day.</p>
    
    <p>After having watched "Pay It Forward," Travis decided he would like to get into acting. He was so moved by the story and Haley Joel Osment's acting in the movie. He wanted to be able to move others like he had been.</p>
    
    <p>At the age of 12, Travis started his acting journey by taking acting classes locally in the Fraser Valley. In grade 8, he got a role as a soldier in the school's performance of Romanoff & Juliet. The next year, he played the housekeeper in the Sound of Music.</p>
    
    <p>He has considered pursuing community theatre in recent years. When he saw "Jesus Christ Superstar" performed by a local theatre group, it reminded him how much he enjoyed being part of the theatre.</p>
